TODO:
Grabbable objects need a "grab point" that is a transform that tells the object where to put the force when the player picks up an object.
Continue to tweak forklift, still a little too wobbly, needs a larger base.
Interactable terminal.
Train that gets loaded with boxes.
Openable door.

BUGS:
Client side forklift movementinputs get overwritten if multiple inputs are pressed at once, eg. can only lift if not moving and vice versa.
